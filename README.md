# New Year Timer

A simple and stylish countdown timer for New Year's Eve, inspired by an event email I received that featured a similar timer. This project is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is deployed with GitHub Pages. Check it out live [here](https://walflower.github.io/new-year-timer/).

## Inspiration

I received an email with a timer for an upcoming event, which inspired me to create a New Year countdown timer. You can see the video of the email that inspired this project [here](https://www.loom.com/share/9fae222cbe284392963016d5b5bbbb54?sid=97f4e9b7-fe54-4d5a-9e94-46adfaf61d17).

## Features

- **Live Countdown**: Displays a real-time countdown to New Year's Day.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience on any device.
- **Celebration Text**: When the timer reaches zero, the timer displays a "Happy New Years" message. You can view a preview of the timer's ending [here](https://www.loom.com/share/455af5cf786f4e2287190854330998fb?sid=00045a8e-32b4-4161-8149-6640e1eb4ce5).
